      <h1>Portfolio Optimization Computation Started</h1>
          <p>
              The optimization for the financial portfolio with the following symbols
          have been started: {symbols:}.
          </p>
          <p>
              The optimization is based on the prices between {startdate:} and {enddate:},
          with maximum total value of the portfolio being USD${maxval:}.
          </p>
          <p>
              Other parameters for the computation using simulated annealing:
              <ul>
                <li>Number of steps: {nbsteps:}</li>
                <li>Initial temperature: {init_temperature:} (temperature decrease every {temperaturechange_step:} by a factor {decfactor:})</li>
                <li>Income from dividends considered: {with_dividends:}</li>
                <li>lambda1 (regularization with volatility): {lambda1:}</li>
                <li>lambda2 (regularization with uniformity): {lambda2:}</li>
                <li>beta computed with respecct to {indexsymbol:}</li>
              </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
              An e-mail will be sent to this e-mail address once the computation is completed.
